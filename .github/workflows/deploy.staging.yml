# Now Github Action Workflow is safety than before
# If your code build failed, it will not stop your web application, your website will work normally
# When Code build complete, Server will only restart (temporary down) in just one or few second
# To improve your Web application quality after each build. I suggest to integrate E2E Test Headless like cypress or Unit test.
